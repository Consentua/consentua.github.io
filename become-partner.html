        <h2>Consentua partner programme</h2>
        <p>Our partner programme allows resellers, consultants and other specialist providers to bring Consentua to new verticals through re-selling on-premises licenses or providing a tailored software-as-a-service offering. If you work with clients for whom Consentua could be a good choice, then please do get in touch with Chris Cooper to receive a copy of our partner pack and arrange an initial discussion.</p>
