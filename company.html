        <h2>What is Consentua?</h2>
        <p>Consentua is a flexible consent management system that helps organisations to build stronger and safer customer relationships.</p>

        <p>Consentua is simple enough to deploy alongside your existing enterprise systems and to adopt incrementally, flexible enough to fit seamlessly with your brand, and powerful enough to cope with whatever requirements you need to throw at it.</p>

        <figure id="quote">
          <h3>Thanks for your interest!</h3>
          <p>We built Consentua because we wanted to make it easier for data controllers to comply with the law, respect data subjectsâ€™ wishes, and handle personal data with the care and respect it deserves.</p>

          <p>Organisations that need consent need Consentua, so please get in touch if we can help.</p>
